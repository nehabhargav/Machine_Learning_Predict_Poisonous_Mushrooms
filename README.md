# Machine_Learning_Predict_Poisonous_Mushrooms
This project uses the available dataset on R studio for mushrooms. Here we have played a little bit with the data .
The code is mainly in R language.
It uses following libraries :
# library(datasets)
# library(FFTrees)
# library(randomForest)
# library(ggplot2)
# library(dplyr)

# How many are  poisonous:
First we check taht from the dataset how many are actually poisonous and how many are not to get an idea .

# Tranning and Test Split
Here we split the dataset that we have into 2 parts .
One would be trannign set that we will be using .
The other would be test set taht we would be using to get the answer .
# train gets 70 percentage of the data 
Here i have used 70:30 ration of Train and test.
You can use any ratio you like but its always better to feed more of traning data .

# Tranning the model
The model is then trained .

# predict

Finally the prediction is made.
